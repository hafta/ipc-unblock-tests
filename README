These tests attempt to measure the time it takes for a thread blocked in one
process to become unblocked and run when signalled by another process.

The shm-unblock-timer uses a pthread mutex in shared memory shared between
two processes. It measures the time between the parent process unlocking the
mutex and the child process being woken up.

pipe-timer measures the time it takes when the child process is blocked on a
pipe read and is woken up by the parent process sending a poke message on the
pipe.

pipe-signal-timer is similar to pipe-timer, but includes a context switch in
the child process. The child process blocks on a pipe read, but when it is
woken up by receiving the poke message, it wakes up a thread in the child
process blocked on a pthread condition variable. The test measures the time
between the parent process sending the pipe message and the child process thread
blocked on the condition variable being woken up.
